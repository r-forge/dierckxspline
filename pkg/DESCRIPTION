Description:
  This package provides a wrapper to the FITPACK routines written by
  Paul Dierckx. The original Fortran is available from
  http://www.netlib.org/dierckx
  2012.02.15:  This package is broken.
  Currently, it seems NOT to have any users and is not worth fixing.
  Dierckx's FITPACK is over 20 years old and seems to be obsolete.
  If you want to fix it, I'm happy to make you the maintainer.
